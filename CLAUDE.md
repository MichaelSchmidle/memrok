# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

memrok is a self-hosted, privacy-first memory service for AI assistants. It implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide persistent context across different AI tools while keeping all data on user infrastructure.

## Architecture

### Core Concepts
- **Knowledge Graph Structure**: Memories are stored as entities, relations, and observations
- **Privacy-First**: All data stored locally, no external dependencies
- **MCP Protocol**: Standardized interface for AI assistant integration
- **Multi-Assistant Support**: Works with Claude, Cursor, VS Code, and other MCP-compatible tools

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Nuxt 4, Vue 3, Nuxt UI Pro 3 (incl. Tailwind CSS 4)
- **Backend**: Nitro server, Bun runtime
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (planned), Qdrant vector DB (planned)
- **Authentication**: Zitadel (OIDC)
- **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose

### Deployment Architecture

**Repository Structure:**
- `memrok-com/app` - Full development environment (this repo)
- `memrok-com/memrok` - Production deployment repo (submodule at `./deployment`)

**Development Setup:**
- Dev configs in app root (CONTRIBUTING.md, package.json scripts)
- Deployment configs in `./deployment` submodule
- Infrastructure: Traefik + Zitadel containers + local Nuxt dev server
- SSL: mkcert for trusted certificates (no browser warnings)
- Domains: `*.dev.memrok.com` (public DNS â†’ 127.0.0.1)

**Production Setup:**
- All configs in deployment submodule
- Infrastructure: Traefik + Zitadel + memrok app containers  
- SSL: Let's Encrypt via Traefik
- Production-ready base configuration with development overrides

**Service Organization:**
- `/deployment/` - Docker Compose configurations
- `/deployment/traefik/` - Reverse proxy configs
- `/deployment/zitadel/` - Zitadel secrets and configurations
- `/deployment/memrok/` - App-specific deployment files
- `/deployment/scripts/` - Utility scripts (cert generation, etc.)

## Development Commands
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## SSL Certificate Trust in Development
The dev server automatically trusts mkcert certificates by setting NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS to the mkcert root CA. This ensures secure communication with Zitadel during development.

## Project Structure

Nuxt 4 uses an organized directory structure with application code in the `/app/` directory:

**Application Code (in `/app/` directory):**
- `/app/pages/`: File-based routing - memories.vue, assistants.vue, settings.vue
- `/app/components/`: Reusable Vue components
- `/app/layouts/`: Page layouts with navigation
- `/app/assets/`: CSS and static assets
- `/app/plugins/`: Client-side plugins
- `/app/middleware/`: Route middleware
- `/app/utils/`: Utility functions
- `/app/i18n/`: Internationalization configuration
- `/app/app.vue`: Root application component
- `/app/app.config.ts`: Application configuration

**Project Root:**
- `/server/`: Nitro server code (API endpoints, MCP implementation)
- `/public/`: Static files
- `/deployment/`: Docker deployment configuration
- `nuxt.config.ts`: Nuxt framework configuration

## Implementation Status

Currently implemented:
- Basic UI structure with navigation
- Page routing setup
- Branding and visual design
- Full authentication integration

Not yet implemented:
- MCP server functionality
- Memory storage and retrieval
- Database connections
- API endpoints
- Docker deployment

## Key Files to Know

- `nuxt.config.ts`: Framework configuration
- `app/app.config.ts`: UI theme and runtime config
- `server/tsconfig.json`: Server-specific TypeScript config
- `app/assets/css/main.css`: Global styles and font imports

## UI Conventions

- Primary color: Indigo
- Neutral color: Stone
- Font families: DM Serif Display (headings), DM Sans (body), DM Mono (code)
- Icons: Phosphor Icons via @iconify-json/ph
- UI components: Nuxt UI Pro library

## Development Infrastructure

### Docker Services
- **Traefik**: Reverse proxy with SSL termination
- **Zitadel**: Authentication service (OIDC/OAuth2)
- **memrok**: Main application (when containerized)

### SSL & Domains
- Development: `*.dev.memrok.com` with mkcert certificates (no hosts file needed - public DNS resolves to 127.0.0.1)
- Production: Let's Encrypt via Traefik 

### Configuration Files
- `deployment/docker-compose.yml`: Production-ready base configuration
- `deployment/docker-compose.dev.yml`: Development overrides only
- `deployment/docker-compose.prod.yml`: Small production override (memrok app only)

## Future Implementation Notes

When implementing core features:
1. MCP server should be in `/server/api/mcp/`
2. Memory storage logic should handle entities, relations, and observations as separate concepts
3. Vector embeddings for semantic search should integrate with Qdrant
4. Authentication uses Zitadel OIDC with nuxt-oidc-auth module
5. Docker setup should include PostgreSQL, Qdrant, and the Nuxt app
6. Tests should be added using Vitest when implemented
